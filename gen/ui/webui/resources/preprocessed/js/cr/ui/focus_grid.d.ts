 *   focusable  [focused]  focusable  (row: 0, col: 1)
 *   focusable  focusable  focusable
 *   focusable  focusable  focusable
 *
 * Pressing the down arrow would result in the focus moving down 1 row and
 * keeping the same column:
 *
 *   focusable  focusable  focusable
 *   focusable  [focused]  focusable  (row: 1, col: 1)
 *   focusable  focusable  focusable
 *
 * And pressing right or tab at this point would move the focus to:
 *
 *   focusable  focusable  focusable
 *   focusable  focusable  [focused]  (row: 1, col: 2)
 *   focusable  focusable  focusable
